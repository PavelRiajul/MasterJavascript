//BASIC THEORY
//AJAX: asynchronous javascript and XML
//HTTP request client - server er maje jee commounication hoi oita HTTP request er maddome hoy
//is a set of 'web development techniques'
//using many web technologies on the 'client-side'
//to create asynchronous web applications

//With Ajax, web applications can send and retrieve
//data from a server asynchronously (in the background)
//without interfering with the display and
//behaviour of the existing page


//we don't use data in xml format anymore.
//we use JSON now

//we have 3 most common ways to create and send request to server
//1)xmlHTTPRequest (old way of doing)
//2)fetch API(new way of doing)
//3)axios(this is third party library)
